# Welcome

Welcome to the FhirStarter.DotNetCore documentation.

This documentations intends on helping you on your way to create your first FhirStarter **R4** project. If you are planning on creating a FHIR server based on the earlier standards (DSTU, DSTU2 or STU3) you'll have to fork the repository and customize the libraries to accommodate the version of the standard you want to use.

Other alternatives to FhirStarter in the .Net world, is [Vonk](https://fire.ly/products/vonk/vonk-fhir-server/) made by Furore.

## Before you begin

The FhirStarter intends on solving the matter of integrating several data sources to one or more FHIR service(s). The FhirStarter is very basic, however it enables the developer to get a FHIR service up and running in a short amount of time. 

## Some assumptions / requirements

* You have Visual Studio 2017++
* .Net Core 2.2.203
* You know Web API 
* You know how to map FHIR resources (check [R4](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/)) through [Forge](https://fire.ly/products/forge/) if you want to validate your resources.

## Getting Started

We've created a guide which helps you along the way to create a FHIR server. Take a look at [Getting started](FHIRService/GettingStarted.md) to begin implemented FHIR.
